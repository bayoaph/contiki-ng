FINAL EXAM

Instructions:

Create a Cooja Simulation of a wireless sensor network deployed in an arbitrary location with the following functions and properties:

1. Create 10 source motes that collect temperature data based on its on-board temperature sensor.
2. Make each source mote transmit temperature data every 15 seconds.
3. Create a sink station that collects all data from source motes.
4. The lights of the sink mode should toggle into red, yellow, and green alternatively every time a data is being received.

You may use all your notes, check out contiki examples, and review all previous exercises to help you write the following files:
a. source C code
b. makefile

You will submit your work as a PR in this repository. Save all your files within the folder where this text file is located.
As such, this folder should contain:
a. Cooja simulation file (.csc)
b. Source file (.c)
c. Sink file (.c)
d. Makefile
