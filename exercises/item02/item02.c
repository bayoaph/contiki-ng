/*
 * Answer/Explanation:
 *
 * Exercise 2a:
 * After compiling and running the program on the sky platform (e.g., using `make TARGET=sky`),
 * press the button on the device. The program will respond by turning on the yellow LED
 * and then printing the current temperature reading to the serial interface. By observing
 * the serial output, you can verify that the button press triggers a temperature reading.
 *
 * Exercise 2b:
 * To make the LED blink instead of staying continuously on, you could use a timer or a
 * loop with `PROCESS_PAUSE()` calls to turn the LED on and off a few times before finally
 * turning it off. Additionally, print "button pressed" each time the button event occurs.
 * For example:
 *
 * - On button press:
 *   - Print "button pressed" to the serial output.
 *   - Blink the LED by turning it on and off several times using `etimer_set()` and waiting
 *     for the timer to expire before toggling the LED state.
 *
 * Exercise 2c:
 * To read the temperature sensor when the button is pressed, we already have the code that
 * activates the SHT11 sensor and reads its value using `sht11_sensor.value(SHT11_SENSOR_TEMP)`.
 * After reading the raw temperature, convert it to a human-readable format using the provided
 * `print_temperature_int_to_float()` function. This will print the temperature in a
 * "X.XXX째C" format to the serial interface each time the button is pressed.
