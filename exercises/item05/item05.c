/*
 * Exercise 5 (to be solved with ILIAS):
 *
 * (a) In Process A, a variable "localVariable" is declared and printed out 10s after
 * the node boots with the value 100.
 * Node B keeps looping and printing random numbers.
 * When you press the "user" button, Process A again prints the value of "localVariable".
 *
 * Q: What value does it have when you run the program:
 *    a) before the button sensor event?
 *    b) after pressing the button?
 *    Why is it like this? Explain.
 *
 * A:
 * Before pressing the button, "localVariable" prints as 100, which is its initialized value.
 * After pressing the button, if "localVariable" is a normal local variable (non-static),
 * its value may not remain stable. Due to how protothreads work, local variables are not
 * guaranteed to persist across blocking calls and context switches. Therefore, it might
 * print an unexpected or corrupted value.
 *
 * To ensure "localVariable" always remains 100, declare it as 'static':
 * static uint16_t localVariable = 100;
 * By making it static, its value persists across yields and remains consistent both before
 * and after pressing the button.
 *
 * (b) Protothread C is a computationally intensive task. If started at boot time, it
 * monopolizes the CPU and prevents A and B from running properly.
 *
 * Why does this happen?
 * Protothreads cooperate by yielding control to each other. If Protothread C never yields,
 * it never gives the scheduler a chance to run A or B, thus "eating up" all CPU time.
 *
 * How to solve this?
 * Insert a yielding call, such as PROCESS_PAUSE(), in Câ€™s loop:
 *
 * while(1) {
 *   // do some computation
 *   PROCESS_PAUSE(); // this yields back to the scheduler
 * }
 *
 * By calling PROCESS_PAUSE(), C allows other protothreads (A and B) to run as well.
 * This ensures that all processes are served fairly by the CPU.
